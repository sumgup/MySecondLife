In one of my previous post, [How not to design your month](https://sumgup.github.io/mysecondlife/HowNotToDesignYourMonth/)  I mentioned how my obsession of tracking goals on everyday basis was not the best decision I made.  If I leave the tracking part than it becomes very simple.  The reason behind not to track on daily basis is because when I start my day I start with a pomodoro sheet.  In that sheet I get to know where I stand on my goals.  For November I started maintaining a notebook. 

This notebook is almost going in the direction of a bullet journal.  Which I think is great because every day I get to review, it is still evolving and I am speculating that I will come up with a system which will be a mix of Pomodoro sheet and bullet journal.  


For now, I want to make monthly planning very simple. For e.g these are my goals for this month:

1. Learning Goals - Finish Empathise, Define and Ideate phase of UX design learning plan.
2. Blogging - I have listed down blog posts that must be written this month. 
3. Body Goals- Yet to come up with a definition for that.

My learning and blogging sometimes happen together and sometime not.  Giving attention to the body is like connecting to the driving force of your life so it comes in equal priority.  

For this month I have simplified it a lot lets see if making it simple can do wonders.
