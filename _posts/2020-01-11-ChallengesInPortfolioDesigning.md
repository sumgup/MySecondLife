# The Challenge

In one of my previous [posts]( https://sumgup.github.io/mysecondlife/DocumentingPortfolio/)  : I came up with all the content required for the case study. Now comes the hard part how I am going to take this content and make it an experience for the reader? 

This is one of the areas I am spending a lot of time because If I don't create a visual experience then no one will take my effort seriously.  All I want is gain and guide attention of the viewer so that they can glance through my case study helping them to make judgement around it.

**These are the challenges** I faced while creating an experience for case study. 

1. Least experience in Visual Design

2. I have the content but how to create experience around it and fit in a visual design.

3. Overthinking - Setting the bar too high by looking at portfolio of experienced designers.

4. Too many frameworks available which one to choose.

# How to meet the challenge?

### 1. Visual Design

I should have taken up courses on Visual Design but due to time constraint, I couldn't.   Visual design is an art.  One should know basics of arts like Lines, Shapes, Colors, Balance etc.  I am not an expert in this area. If one has bandwidth then I would recommend taking up a full course or if you are looking for minimal information then I would suggest browsing a youtube channel GCFLearnFree.org.  These videos are awesome:

At the end of the video, they have links to typography, colours and images.  Typography is a big deal, once done right we can guide the attention of user based on our design decision. 

### 2. Fitting content

I believe this is hard, you have lots of content and you also have a risk that you might burden the user with a lot of information which is not required.  Hard part is how do you layout the information.  I believe horizontal scroll is going to help here.  Watch out for my posts on layout decision I made.

### 3. Overthinking 

I have bookmarks of portfolio of UX designers, they are stunning in many ways.  Being a beginner I set my bar very high. Later I realised that portfolio making is an evolution. I feel most of the portfolio has evolved over time. So don't overthink, I might not be able to reach what I envisioned but as I learn more visual design I will get there. 

### 4. Choosing Framework

This is one area where I went wrong.  I started with Bootstrap.js and later when I looked into frameworks like FullPage.js I felt my portfolio thinking is not great.  When I learned web design principle I realised that I shouldn't be thinking in terms of frameworks instead focus on basics.

# Takeaways :

1. Focus on basics of web design like

   a. Typography - Its everywhere, even in this blog post.

   b. Balance in the visual design

   c. Animation to make it interesting

2. Layouts -  Think in terms of how you want to layout your visual design.  Browser for patterns on web.

3. In free time learn visual design a formal course is must have.
