Its been a while since I wrote about my journey. Mostly I was blogging about Design thinking but not about my journey as such.

One of the unknown areas in my journey is that I don't have much idea about where to find work that too as a freelance designer. The portfolio is under construction and will have a case study.

The case study is part of education. This makes me doubt if it will be accepted or not. One of my desires is that when I go out, I go strong so that no one can find holes in what I have done. 

This is both interesting and difficult.  I can afford to do some free work to build my portfolio.  I believe that could be the right pitch.  These are the things in my mind to people to pitch to:

\#1. Startups or accelerators.

\#2. Design agencies.

\#3. Find work through my references.

The most interesting work I can find is with startups.  Here are the ways I can think of finding a startup.

1. Go out find accelerators and pitch them - Should I carry a business card?
2. Create a Bumble profile and meet co-founders interested in UX designer.

Let's keep it simple, till the year-end focus on portfolio building and parallel focus on listing down startups and accelerators.  I mean finding their whereabouts.   Once the portfolio is ready I will go out and hunt for startups. 

Sounds like a plan.
