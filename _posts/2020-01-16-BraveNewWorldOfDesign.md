Designing my case study page has been both an exhusting journey as well as one of the most inspiring phase of my life.

There has been times I struggled with, I created so many designs and rejected them.  Once I took a crash course in design I realized what I was missing.

Design is all about playing with attention system of viewer. A good design guides the viewers attention system to what content is trying to say.  I guess creating a good design will be always a struggle because you dream high and you fail.  You get up and design again.  Until you reach to a point where you have laid out a solid foundation in which you can built on.  

There is nothing like epitome of design, you just keep evolving it until you feel happy.  I am glad that portfolio building exercise bought the best out of me. 

One of my greatest learnings is the role of Typography in Design.  Getting this right is a major win.  No body likes to read boring text.
