The motivation behind writing this post is how "User Experience Design" can help a business to achieve its objectives and potential. 



If I have to explain UX design to business owner then I would start with mistakes made in software development and making the business owner aware that we have been making these mistakes for a while. As a result of these mistakes lot of ideas have failed or increased the cost of development.  This will help him/her in getting them educated and they can make the right decisions. 



Let's start with failures, why do so many new business ideas fail to make it to the market.  I would rely on an expert like Paul Graham. 



Why do most startups fail? I am certainly not an expert in this area but if we listen to experts like Paul Graham, founder of YCombinator which is an incubator and resulted in startups like Airbnb, Stripe, Dropbox and lot more. 

"There's just one mistake that kills startups: not making something users want. If you make something users want, you'll probably be fine, whatever else you do or don't do. And if you don't make something users want, then you're dead, whatever else you do or don't do."

This leads to the question of how can startups make something that user desires. If we have to answer this question than I would think more about the problem than the solution. 

**What are obstructions that are preventing to create a solution that customer wants?** 

It is a known devil and a friend: Technology.  I will focus on why it's a devil because our society has been conditioned to invest in engineering. In engineering what gets taught is technology i.e. Microprocessors, RAM. With such a technology-oriented mindset when engineers joiThere are a lot more obstructions in building a successful business but this is the root cause of the problem. I have worked in tech for more than a decade and I strongly advocate to not to start a company by hiring engineers. Start with people who care about needs, people who are deeply interested in knowing about customers. n businesses they start from technology and go all the way up to creating a product or solution. 

A tech company is conditioned to think from the perspective of what technology can offer not what the user wants. Steve Jobs has clearly reasoned success behind Apple:

**'You've got to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology. You can't start with the technology and try to figure out where can I sell it.' Steve Jobs**

What customer wants is the desirable aspect of a business.  Every business starts with an idea and tries to reach the sweet spot of success and innovation.

Picture above is the abstraction of what a business should desire. 

Here are the part which makes this sweet spot:

1. Desirability - Desirable. Having pleasing qualities or properties.

   Are we creating a product solution that anyone needs? 

   What is the unique value proposition?

2. Viability - The ability to live grow and develop.

   Can we build a sustainable business?

3. Feasibility - Capable of being done or carried out.

   Will the product work? Can we see it in real in near future?

   

   To put it simple words one may have a desire to travel to Europe for vacation.  In order to fulfil this desire we need Money and Carrier (aeroplane/ship).  Carrier covers the Feasibility aspect and its the money which makes the trip Viable.

For a business to be successful all the pieces have to work in harmony i.e. Value Proposition, Pricing, Financial model  etc.  

If we know key ingredients that makes a business successful and we have to start from customer experience than how do we begin? Will cover this as part two of this blog post.
