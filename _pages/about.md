I am Sumit, currently learning UX design to become a freelance UX Designer. While I am on the way to learn UX design I thought to document my whole journey starting from who I was, why UX design, my present and future to come by.

Before this, I was a Software Consultant developing full-stack solutions. For me, this blog page is my journey to second life.

I have had several reasons why I chose the UX design. Firstly this is something that I was doing in free time. I never made it big but I loved the process through which we create a design. Secondly, I was driven towards psychology while studying Philosophy my learning was to see how our mind works. This to me was beginning to psychology and am glad that design presents a unique opportunity to apply what you know about Psychology. Isn't this exciting? Lastly, I love going through apps and its flows. Most of the time it's me in my  peer group who discovers a new app, which helps me in learning what's latest. 

It's my journey, as a human being I had my fears, apprehensions and excitement. I am not here to share the bright or low side of the journey but to share things as they are. An un-distorted version

Several thoughts were against me to not to write like:

1. What if I fail in becoming a UX Designer.
2. Is this more of a stunt to gain pride?
3. What will others think about me?
4. Why share a personal side of myself?
5. I have not failed or achieved some level of success, what's the point?
6. Will my writing help anyone?
7. Why waste time unless you have reached the goal.

I realized instead of self-doubting it's better to face fears as is. The person who benefits the most out of this writing is me. My writing may help others but its a way to organize my thoughts and self-introspection.

If you have any feedback for this blog or you would like me to blog about any other topic, please leave a comment here or email me on sumit4palz@gmail.com

Thanks.
