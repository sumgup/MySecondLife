    I am Sumit, currently learning UX design to become a freelance UX Designer.  While I am on the way to learn UX design I thought to document my whole journey starting from who I was, why UX design, my present and future to come by.</p>
<p>Prior to this I was a Software Consultant developing full stack solutions. For me this blog page is my journey to second life.</p>
<p>I have written a post on why I am pursuing UX design, posted here: <a href="https://sumgup.github.io/mysecondlife/CaughtPursuingUXDesign/" >Caught Pursuing UX Design</a></p>


<p>Its my personal journey, as a human being I had my own fears, apprehensions and excitement.  I am not here to share the bright or low side of journey but to share things as they are. An un-distorted version</p>
<p>There were several thoughts that were against myself to not to write like:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What if I fail in becoming a UX Designer.</li>
  <li>Is this more of a stunt to gain pride?</li>
  <li>What will others think about me?</li>
  <li>Why to share a personal side of myself?</li>
  <li>I have not failed or achieved some level of success, whats the point?</li>
  <li>Will my writing help anyone?</li>
  <li>Why waste time unless you have reached the goal.</li>
</ol>

<p>I realized Instead of self doubting its better to face fears as is.  The person who benefits the most out of this writing is myself.  My writing may help others but its a way to organize my thoughts and self introspection.</p>
If you have any feedback for this blog or you would like me to blog about any other topic, please leave comment here or email me on sumit4palz@gmail.com
