<p>I am Sumit, currently learning UX design to become a freelance UX Designer. While I am on the way to learn UX design I thought to document my whole journey starting from who I was, why UX design, my present and future to come by.</p>
<p>Before this, I was a Software Consultant developing full-stack solutions. For me, this blog page is my journey to second life.</p>
<p>I have had several reasons why I chose the UX design. Firstly this is something that I was doing in free time. I never made it big but I loved the process through which we create a design. Secondly, I was driven towards psychology while studying Philosophy my learning was to see how our mind works. This to me was beginning to psychology and am glad that design presents a unique opportunity to apply what you know about Psychology. Isn&#39;t this exciting? Lastly, I love going through apps and its flows. Most of the time it&#39;s me in my  peer group who discovers a new app, which helps me in learning what&#39;s latest. </p>
<p>It&#39;s my journey, as a human being I had my fears, apprehensions and excitement. I am not here to share the bright or low side of the journey but to share things as they are. An un-distorted version</p>
<p>Several thoughts were against me to not to write like:</p>
<ol>
<li>What if I fail in becoming a UX Designer.</li>
<li>Is this more of a stunt to gain pride?</li>
<li>What will others think about me?</li>
<li>Why share a personal side of myself?</li>
<li>I have not failed or achieved some level of success, what&#39;s the point?</li>
<li>Will my writing help anyone?</li>
<li>Why waste time unless you have reached the goal.</li>

</ol>
<p>I realized instead of self-doubting it&#39;s better to face fears as is. The person who benefits the most out of this writing is me. My writing may help others but its a way to organize my thoughts and self-introspection.</p>
